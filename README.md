# Sorting alghorithms
 
A small repository with some of the most popular sorting algorithms used to sort a text file.
The main goal of this repository is to apply the sorting algorithms more practically and have a dictionary of those algorithms when I need to revise them.

**The practical time might differ from system to system.
I have run the tests on the Apple M2 CPU.**

## Implemented algorithms.

### Bubble Sort:
- Best-case performance O(n^2) or O(n) if the list is already sorted.
- Average-case performance O(n^2)
- Worst-case performance O(n^2)
- Practical time on the text file: ~18.99 sec.

### Selection sort:
- Best-case performance O(n^2) or O(n) if the list is already sorted.
- Average-case performance O(n^2)
- Worst-case performance O(n^2)
- Practical time on the text file: ~5.79 sec.

### Insertion sort:
- Best-case performance  O(n) if the list is already sorted.
- Average-case performance O(n^2)
- Worst-case performance O(n^2)
- Practical time on the text file:  ~3.2 sec.

### Merge sort:
- Best-case performance  O(n log n) if the list is sorted.
- Average-case performance O(n log n)
- Worst-case performance O(n log n) if the array is in reverse order.
- Practical time on the text file:  ~0.026 sec.

### Quick sort:
- Best-case performance  O(n log n) if the list is sorted.
- Average-case performance O(n log n)
- Worst-case performance O(n^2)
- Practical time on the text file:  ~0.019 sec.

## Moving forward:
- Extend the repository and implement searching algorithms as well.
- Create an automated system that runs the algorithms multiple times and calculates the average, best and worst practical time.
